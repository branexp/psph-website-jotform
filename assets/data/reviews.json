      "review_text": "Robert was so helpful and informative during our recent session about my pension and retirement plans. He was extremely knowledgeable and insightful, and he took the time to answer all of my questions, present me with different options, and he showed me numbers based on those options. He was also very nice and easy to talk to - I felt like he understood all of my concerns, and he really had my best interests in mind. I highly recommend speaking with Robert if you have any questions or concerns about your pension options.",

      "review_text": "Cal from Rise North Capital has been incredibly helpful for me over the last year or so. When he and I first met I had 2 different 401k’s or 403b’s with 3 different jobs and I was just starting out at a new job about to open a 4th account with my new company. I had no idea how to roll any of them over into each other, but Cal not only helped explain the process to me, he called each company with me on the line to walk through the process together to make it as painless as possible. Now all of my money sits in 1 account to collect as much interest as possible, and he and I have moved on to other financial goals together. I can honestly say I never would have done that without his help. I’m so grateful to Rise North Capital to their services, and Cal specifically for how knowledgeable, responsive, and kind he has been every step of the way. Highly recommend this company!",
